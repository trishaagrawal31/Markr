/**
 * Synchronous in-memory state for the currently selected AI service and model.
 *
 * Chrome storage writes are async — when the user picks a new model in the
 * Dropdown (fire-and-forget onSelect), the storage write may not finish before
 * the user navigates back and clicks "Organize this page".  Reading from
 * storage at that point returns the OLD value.
 *
 * This module keeps a synchronous mirror that is written to instantly (plain
 * JS assignment) and read from instantly — zero async gap.  Chrome storage
 * is still written to in parallel for persistence across popup sessions.
 *
 * On popup open, call `initSelectedState()` once to seed from Chrome storage.
